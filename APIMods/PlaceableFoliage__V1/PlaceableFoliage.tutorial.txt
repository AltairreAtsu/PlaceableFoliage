Welcome to the Placeable Foliage mod. Thank you for installing and trying it out!

To get started all mod Recipes can be found under the Terraforming recipe category. Simply collect two of any dye and craft them together to get a placeable flower block of that color. Upon placing that block a flower will instantly be created in that position. The same is true for tall grass. Craft two dried grass together and you will receive a placeable tall grass block!
